1. Create a Beer JPA entity. The JPA entity should use Project Lombok Getters, Setters, Builder, NoArgs and AllArgs constructors. Use Integer for the ID and version. Add the properties String beerName, String beerStyle, String upc, Integer quantityOnHand, BigDecimal price, and JPA properties for createdDate and updateDate using LocalDateTime. Also make sure all the tests pass

2. in the package controllers, create a new Spring mvc controller for the beer entity. Add operations for create, get by id and list all. in the package services create a service interface and implementation. add methods as needed to support the controller operations using the spring data repository. The controller should only use the service and the service will use the Spring Data JPA repository for persistence operations. Create spring mockmvc tests for the controller operations. Verify tests are passing

3. inspect the beer controller, add API endpoints for update and delete. Create new service methods. Add additional mock MVC tests for the new API operations. create a unit test to test all service operations

4. Analyze the project structure and tech stack and generate a `.junie/guidelines.md` file with consise well structired information to help new developers. Include a guidance on organizinfg the structure, runnign tests , executing scripts and following best practices. Keep the content short, clear and practical.

5. Inspect the OpenAPI specification in openapi/openapi/openapi.yaml. This is the API documentation for this project. Observe how file file references are used. Note how the file names from path operations are determined from the path of the API, and how components such as headers and schemas are defined in file references. Update the file junie/guidelines.md with a description of the API documentation, file naming conventions, and how components are defined. Provide instructions about testing the OpenAPI Specification using the command npm test.

6. Inspect the Spring MVC controller BeerController and comments on the DTOs accepted and returned. Update the OpenAPI specification for the operations in the BeerController. Provide constraint information, descriptions, and examples in the schema object.
